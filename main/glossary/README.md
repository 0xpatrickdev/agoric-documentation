# Glossary

This page lists words, expressions, or concepts used by the Agoric technology stack.

## Agoric CLI
A command line interface for installing dependencies and initializing, deploying, and starting Agoric projects.
See the [Agoric CLI Guide](./getting-started/agoric-cli-guide.md).

## AllegedName
Human-readable name of a kind of rights. The alleged name should
not be trusted as an accurate depiction, since it is provided by
the maker of the mint and could be deceptive, but is useful for debugging and double-checking.

The AllegedName must be a string.

## Allocation

Allocations represent the amounts to be paid out to each [seat](#seat) on exit from a contract instance. Possible exits are exercising 
an exit condition, the contract's explicit choice, or a crash or freeze. There are several methods for finding
out what amount a current allocation is. 

In more detail, Zoe's guarantee is each seat will either get what it asked for in its offer, or the return of what was deposited.
The contract can reallocate fairly arbitrarily to achieve that. As contract code is visible to its clients, users can see
what the contract intends to do.

Zoe enforces those terms by keeping track of a current allocation for each seat. The initial allocation is the deposit. 
The contract can modify a seat's allocation as long as it never violates offer safety or rights conservation. i.e. it can't 
assign assets that weren't already in some allocation and it can't assign them to more than one seat. Also, goods can't 
disappear from the total allocation.

## AmountMath
AmountMath executes the logic of how [amounts](#amounts) are changed when digital assets are merged, separated,
or otherwise manipulated. For example, a deposit of 2 bucks into a purse that already has 3 bucks 
gives a new balance of 5 bucks. But, a deposit of a non-fungible theater ticket into a purse that already holds
five tickets isn't done by numeric addition. AmountMath has a single set of polymorphic
methods of three different kinds to deal with [fungible](#fungible) assets (values are natural numbers) and
[non-fungible](#non-fungible) assets (values are an array or object). The three AmountMathKinds are
- `MathKind.NAT`: Used with fungible assets. Amount values are natural numbers (non-negative integers). Default value.
- `MathKind.STRING_SET`: Used with non-fungible assets. Amount values are strings.
- `MathKind.SET`: Used with non-fungible assets. Amount values are objects or records with multiple properties.

For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's AmountMath section](./ertp/guide/amount-math.md) 
and the [ERTP API's AmountMath section](./ertp/api/amount-math.md).

## Amounts
Amounts are the canonical description of tradable goods. They are manipulated
by [issuers](#issuer) and [mints](#mint), and represent the goods and currency carried by
[purses](#purse) and [payments](#payment). They represent things like currency, stock, and the
abstract right to participate in a particular exchange.

An amount is comprised of a [brand](#brand) with an [value](#value). For example, "4 quatloos"
is an amount with a value of "4" and a brand of the imaginary currency "quatloos".

For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's Amounts section](./ertp/guide/amounts.md) 
and the [ERTP API's AmountMath section](./ertp/api/amount-math.md).

## AssetHolder
[Purses](#purse) and [payments](#payment) are AssetHolders. These are objects that contain [amounts](#amount).

## Brand
Identifies the kind of [issuer](#issuer), such as "quatloos", "moola", etc. Brands are one of the two elements that 
make up an [amount](#amount).
For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's Brand section](./ertp/guide/brand.md)
and the [ERTP API's Brand section](./ertp/api/brand.md).

## Bundle

Before a contract can be installed on Zoe, its source code must be bundled. This is done by:
```
import bundleSource from '@agoric/bundle-source';
const atomicSwapBundle = await bundleSource(
    require.resolve('@agoric/zoe/src/contracts/atomicSwap'),
);
```
The installation operation returns
an `installation`, which is an object with one property; `bundle`. You can access an installed contract's source
code via `invitation.bundle.source`.

## Burn

Destroy all digital assets in a payment. See [`issuer.burn(payment, optAmount)`](/ertp/api/issuer.md#issuer-burn-payment-optamount) 

## Comparable

A *passable* is something that can be marshalled. A *comparable* is a
passable whose leaves contain no promises. Two comparables can be
synchronously compared for structural equivalence.

A comparable is a JavaScript object containing no promises, and can
thus be locally compared for equality with another object. If either object
contains Promises, equality is indeterminable. If both are fulfilled down
to Presences and local state, then either they're the same all the way
down, or they represent different objects.

## Contract and Contract Instance
In Agoric documentation, *contract* usually refers to a contract's source code that defines how the contract works. A contract's source code is *installed* on Zoe. A contract is *instantiated* to create *contract instances*, which are the active execution of a contract's code running on Zoe.  

For example, a realtor has a standard house selling agreement. The contract is the code defining how that agreement works. When the realtor has a new house to sell, they instantiate a new instance of their standard contract for that specific property. If they have ten houses for sale, they have ten different contract instances.

## CreatorInvitation

An invitation returned by `startInstance()` that the contract instance creator can use. It is usually used in contracts where the creator immediately sells something (auctions, swaps, etc.). 

## dIBC

Dynamic version of the [Inter-Blockchain Communication](#ibc) protocol. See [here](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/SwingSet/docs/networking.md) for more details.

## E()

(Also referred to as *eventual send*) `E()` is a local "bridge" function that invokes methods on remote objects, for example
in another vat, machine, or blockchain. It takes a local representative (a proxy) for a remote object as an argument and 
sends messages to it using normal message-sending syntax. The local proxy forwards all messages to the remote object to deal with. 
All `E()` calls return a promise for the eventual returned value. For more detail, see 
the [`E()` section in the Distributed JavaScript page](/distributed-programming.html#communicating-with-remote-objects-using-e).

## ERTP
*Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol* is a uniform way of transferring tokens and other digital assets, 
both [fungible](#fungible) and [non-fungible](#non-fungable), in JavaScript. All kinds of digital assets
can easily be created and they can be all be transferred in exactly the same ways, with exactly the same security properties.

It uses [object capabilities](#object-capabilities) to enforce access control. Instead of having 
to prove ownership of a corresponding private key, if your program has a 
reference to an object, it can call methods on that object. If it doesn't 
have a reference, it can't. For more on object capabilities, see [this post](http://habitatchronicles.com/2017/05/what-are-capabilities/).

Key ERTP concepts include [Issuers](#issuer), [Mints](#mint), 
[Purses](#purse), [Payments](#payment), [Brands](#brand), and [Amounts](#amount). Also 
see the [ERTP Introduction](./getting-started/ertp-introduction.md),
[ERTP Guide](./ertp/guide/), and [ERTP API](./ertp/api/).

## Escrow

Giving assets for a possible transaction to an impartial third party, who keeps them until specified conditions are satisfied. 
For example, Alice wants to sell Bob a ticket for $100. Alice escrows the ticket, and Bob escrows the $100, with Carol. Carol
does not give Alice the $100 or Bob the ticket until she has both items. Since neither Alice nor Bob ever holds both items at
once, they don't have to trust each other to do the transaction. Zoe automatically escrows payments for transaction offers.

## Eventual Send

See [`E()`](#e) above.

## Exit Rule

Part of an offer specifying how the offer can be cancelled/exited. There are three values:
- `onDemand:null`: (Default) The offering party can cancel on demand.
- `waived:null`: The offering party can't cancel and relies entirely on the smart contract to promptly finish their offer.
- `afterDeadline`: The offer is automatically cancelled after a deadline, as determined by its timer and deadline properties.

## Facet

A particular view or API of an object. An object can have many facets. Two Agoric uses are:
- Deposit Facet: A facet of a [purse](#purse). Anyone with a reference to its deposit facet object can add 
  appropriately branded assets to the purse, but cannot withdraw assets from the purse or find out its balance.
- Public Facet: A set of methods and properties for an object that a developer chooses to be publicly visible and usable.

## Fungible
A fungible asset is one where all exemplars of the asset are interchangeable. For example, if you 
have 100 one dollar bills and need to pay someone five dollars, it does not matter which
five one dollar bills you use. Also see [non-fungible](#non-fungible).

## Handle
A handle is a unique identifier implemented as a JavaScript object. Only its identity is meaningful, so handles do not have properties. Unlike number or string identifiers, handles are unforgeable. This means the only way to know a handle identity is being given an object reference, and no identity can be guessed and no fake identity will succeed. 

For example, Zoe often uses `offerHandle` to refer to offers. Zoe contracts can use an offer's `offerHandle` as the key for requesting the current allocation of an offer or reallocating the offer's assets.

## Harden

A hardened objectâ€™s properties cannot be changed, so the only way to interact with a hardened object is through its methods.
`harden()` is similar to `Object.freeze()` but more powerful. For more about `harden()`, see
its [section in the JavaScript Distributeed Programming Guide](/distributed-programming.md#harden)

## IBC

The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, used to by blockchains to communicate with each other. A short article about IBC
is available [here](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Open-Source-Insider/What-developers-need-to-know-about-inter-blockchain-communication).

## Invitation

## InvitationIssuer

## Issuer
Issuers are a one-to-one relationshp with both a [mint](#mint) and a [brand](#brand), so each issuer works
with one and only one asset type, such as only working with quatloos or only working
with moola. This association cannot change to another type. 

Issuers can create empty [purses](#purse) and [payments](#payment) for
their asset type, but cannot mint new [amounts](#amount). Issuers can also transform
payments of their asset type (splitting, combining, burning, and exclusively claiming
payments). An issuer from a trusted source can determine if an untrusted payment of
its asset type is valid. 

For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's Issuer section](./ertp/guide/issuer.md)
and the [ERTP API's Issuer section](./ertp/api/issuer.md).

## Keywords

Keywords are unique identifiers per contract. They tie together the proposal, payments 
to be escrowed, and payouts to the user by serving as keys for key-value pairs in various 
records with values of amounts, issuers, etc.

## Mint
Agoric has two mint objects, *ERTP mints* and *Zoe Contract Facet mints (ZCFMints)*. They both create
digital assets. Which mint type creates an asset doesn't matter; quatloos created by an ERTP mint and 
indistinguishable from quatloos created by a ZCFMint. 

- ERTP mints create digital assets asynchronously and are the only ERTP objects with the authority to do so. 
  Access to an ERTP mint gives you the power to create more digital assets of its type at will. Mints
  can only create one type of asset and cannot change to create a different type.

  ERTP mints are [issuer's](#issuer) admin [facets](#facet), and there is a one-to-one relationship between an issuer and
  its mint. ERTP mints are also in a one-to-one relationship with that issuer's associated [brand](#brand).

- ZCFMints are synchronous Zoe mints, which mint and reallocate digital assets synchronously 
  instead of asynchronously like ERTP mints. Similar to ERTP mints, they have one-to-one relationships
  with an issuer and its associated brand.
  
ZCFMints and ERTP mints do **not** have the same methods. Do not try to use ERTP methods on a ZCFMint or vice versa.
However, issuers, brands, and amountMaths associated with either an ERTP mint or a ZCFMint do have the same methods.

For more information on ERTP mints, see the [ERTP Guide's Mint section](./ertp/guide/mint.md) 
and the [ERTP API's Mint section](./ertp/api/mint.md). For more information about ZCFMints, 
see the [zcfMakeZCFMint() API entry](./zoe/api/zoe-contract-facet.html#zcf-makezcfmint-keyword-amountmathkind) in the Zoe Contract Facet API.

## Moola
An imaginary currency Agoric docmentation uses in examples.

## Non-fungible
A non-fungible asset is one where each incidence of the asset has unique individual properties and
is not interchangeable with another incidence. For example, if your asset is show tickets, it matters to the buyer 
what the date and time of the show is, which row the seat is in, and where in the row the 
seat is (and likely other factors as well). You can't just give them any ticket in your supply,
as they are not interchangeable (and may have different prices). See also [fungible](#fungible).

## Notifier

A notifier provides a stream of updates describing changes to the state of an offer.

For more information, see [here](./distributed-programming.md#notifiers).

## Object Capabilities

Objects have state, behavior, and references. Lets say Object A has references to Objects B 
and C, while B and C do not have references to each other. Thus, A can communicate with B and C, 
and B and C cannot communicate with each other. There is an effective zero-cost firewall between B and C.

An *object capability system* constrains how references are obtained. You can't get one just by 
knowing the name of a global variable or a public class. You can pnly get a reference via: 
- Creation: Functions that create objects get a reference to them.
- Construction: Constructors can endow their constructed objects with references, including inherited references. 
- Introduction: 
  - A has references to B and C. 
  - B and C do *not* have references to each other
  - A sends B a reference to C. 
    - B now has a reference to C and can communicate with C. 

If references can only be obtained by creation, construction, or introduction, you may have a safe system. If they can be obtained in any other way, your system is unsafe.

For more information, see [Douglas Crockford on Object Capabilities](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/good-parts-javascript-web/object-capabilities/).

## Offer

Offers are a structured way of describing user intent. In Zoe, an offer consists of a proposal (the 
rules under which the party wants to exercise the offer) and payments corresponding to what the proposal specifies as what the
party will give if the offer is satisfied. The payments are automatically escrowed by Zoe, and appropriately reallocated when
the offer exits with either success or rejection. See [`E(Zoe).offer(invitation, proposal, paymentKeywordRecord)`](https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/api/zoe.html#e-zoe-offer-invitation-proposal-paymentkeywordrecord).

## Offer Safety

Zoe guarantees offer safety. When a user makes an offer and it is escrowed with Zoe, Zoe guarantees that 
the user either gets what they said they wanted, or gets back (refunded) what they originally offered and escrowed.

## Payment   **tyg**
Payments hold [amounts](#amount) of certain assets 
issued by [Mints](#mint). Specifically amounts from one party to another. 
Amounts from payments can be deposited in [purses](#purse), but otherwise, the entire amount is 
available when the payment is transferred. Payments can be converted to [Purses](#purse). All contents 
of a purse must be of the same [brand](#brand).

For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's Payments section](./ertp/guide/purses-and-payments.md#purses-and-payments)
and the [ERTP API's Payments section](./ertp/api/payment.md).

## Payout

## Presence **tyg**
A local version of a remote object that serves as the remote object's proxy. 
If `obj` is a presence of a remote object, you can send messages to the remote object by using `E()` on `obj`. 
For more information, see the [JavaScript Distributed Programming Guide](./distributed-programming.md). 

## Proposal

Proposals are records with give, want, and exit keys. Offers must include a proposal, which states
what asset you want, what asset you will give for it, and how/when the offer maker can cancel the offer
(see [Exit Rule](#exit-rule) for details on the last). For example:
```
const myProposal = harden({
  give: { Asset: quatloosAmountMath.make(4)},
  want: { Price: moolaAmountMath.make(15) },
  exit: { 'onDemand'
})
```
give and want use [keywords](#keywords) defined by the contract. Each specifies via an [amount](#amounts), a description of what
asset they are willing to give/want to get, and how much of it. 

## Purse **tyg**
Purses hold [amounts](#amount) of a certain [mint](#mint) issued assets. Specifically amounts that are _stationary_. Purses can transfer part of their held balance to a [payment](#payment), which is usually used to transfer value. A purse's contents are all of the same [brand](#brand).

For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's Purses section](https://agoric.com/documentation/ertp/guide/purses-and-payments.md#purses-and-payments) and the
[ERTP API's Purses section](./ertp/api/purse.md).

## Quatloos
An imaginary currenty Agoric docmentation uses in examples. For its origins, see the Wikipedia entry for the Star Trek 
episode [The Gamesters of Triskelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamesters_of_Triskelion).

## Reallocate

When an offer exits due either to success or rejection, the associated payments that were escrowed with Zoe are automatically
appropriately reallocated to the offer participants. If the offer was rejected or otherwise failed, Zoe gives the offer-making party back what
they escrowed. If the offer was accepted, Zoe allocates the user what they said they wanted. There are cases where the reallocation both
gives a party what they wanted and some of what they escrowed. For example, in an auction a party might have escrowed 10 Quatloos to make their
highest bid if necessary, but they won the item with a bid of just 8 Quatloos. The reallocation would give them both the item they won and
a refund of the 2 Quatloos that weren't needed to purchase it. 

## Seat  **tyg**

Zoe uses seats to represent offers, and has two seat [facets](#facet); a [ZCFSeat](#zcfseat) and a [UserSeat](#userseat).

Seats represent active offers and let contracts and users interact with them. ZCFSeats are used 
within contracts and with `zcf.` methods. User seats represent offers external to Zoe and the 
contract. The party who exercises an invitation and sends the `offer()` message to Zoe 
gets a UserSeat that can check payouts' status or retrieve their results.

## SeatStagings

## Simoleons
An imaginary currency Agoric docmentation uses in examples.

## Terms

## Value

Values are the part of an [amount](#amount) that describe the value of something
that can be owned or shared: How much, how many, or a description of a unique asset, such as
Pixel(3,2), $3, or 'Seat J12 for the show September 27th at 9:00pm'.
[Fungible](#fungible) values are usually 
represented by natural numbers. Other values may be represented as strings naming a particular
right, or an arbitrary object representing the rights at issue. The latter two examples 
are usually [non-fungible](#nonfungible) assets. Values must be [Comparable](#comparable).

For more information, see the [ERTP Guide's Value section](https://agoric.com/documentation/ertp/guide/amounts.html#values).

## Vat **tyg**

A vat is a *unit of synchrony*. This means that within a JavaScript vat, objects and functions can communicate with one another synchronously.

A vat runs a single *event loop*.

A physical machine can run one or several vats. A blockchain can run one or several communicating vats.

Different vats can communicate by sending asynchronous messages to other vats.

A vat is the moral equivalent of a Unix Process.

## ZCF (Zoe Contract Facet)

A set of Zoe API methods made visible on a Zoe facet. They can be called synchronously by contract code. 
See the [ZCF API](/zoe/api/zoe-contract-facet.md).

## ZCFMint

See [Mint](#mint).

## Zoe Helpers

A set of API helper methods for writing contracts. These methods extract common contract code and
patterns into reusable helpers. See the [Zoe Helpers API](/zoe/api/zoe-helpers.md).

## Zoe Service

A set of API methods for deploying and working with smart contracts. See [Zoe Service API](/zoe/api/zoe.md).
