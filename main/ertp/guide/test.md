# Amounts, Values, and Brands

## Values

![Value methods](./assets/value.svg) 

Values are the "how many" part of `amount` objects. `value`s have no
methods of their own, but several `amountMath` methods use or return
them. Otherwise, see the [Amounts](#amounts) section for methods which interact
with complete `amount` objects, including their `value` part.
