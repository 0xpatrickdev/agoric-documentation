# ERTP Glossary

## ERTP
Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol - a smart contract framework that uses object capabilities to enforce access control. Instead of having to prove ownership of a corresponding private key, in the world of object capabilities, if your program has a reference to an object, it can call methods on that object. If it doesn't have a reference, it can't. For more on object capabilities, see [Chip Morningstar's post](http://habitatchronicles.com/2017/05/what-are-capabilities/).

## Mint
The right to control issuance and destruction of purses and payments containing `units` of a particular currency.
